Hackathon-Ready

"I want to build a project called Aureus: Decentralized Wealth Preservation, focused on protecting long-term savings against inflation and currency debasement. The project should leverage Composability, Stellar Blockchain, DeFi, Rust, and Oracles.

Core Vision

Aureus manages user savings portfolios with automatic, on-chain adjustments based on real-world inflation data and FX currency debasement, ensuring retirement funds are preserved in stable and inflation-resistant assets.

System Architecture (no UI for MVP)

Smart Contracts Layer (Rust on Soroban)

Portfolio Contract: Manages user deposits, allocations, and rebalancing triggers.

Inflation Hedge Contract: Shifts allocations into inflation-resistant assets (stablecoins, tokenized commodities, yield strategies).

Savings Contract: Handles deposits, locks, staking, and withdrawals.

Oracle Contract: Receives and stores CPI, FX, and asset price data for real-time adjustments.

Blockchain Layer (Stellar)

Settlement of deposits and withdrawals.

Stellar stablecoins as the base unit for retirement portfolios.

Immutable savings records for transparency.

DeFi Integrations

Liquidity pools for FX rebalancing.

Yield-bearing protocols for portfolio growth.

Tokenized commodities/gold for inflation hedging.

Data & Oracles

CPI inflation indexes for country-specific adjustments.

FX rates for tracking local currency debasement.

Asset price feeds to optimize allocations.

Step-by-Step Roadmap with Commit Messages
Phase 1: MVP â€“ Core Savings Contract

Build savings contract in Rust/Soroban to accept deposits, withdrawals, and basic locks.

Integrate Stellar stablecoin support.

ðŸ’» Commit: feat: add core savings contract with deposit/withdraw/lock functionality using Soroban

Phase 2: Oracle Integration

Connect oracle feeds for CPI inflation rates, FX currency rates, and asset prices.

Store fetched data on-chain via Oracle Contract.

Add automatic inflation-adjusted rebalancing triggers.

ðŸ’» Commit: feat: integrate oracle contract for CPI, FX, and asset price feeds with inflation-adjustment logic

Phase 3: Inflation Hedge Module

Implement Inflation Hedge Contract that rebalances funds into stablecoins, tokenized commodities, or yield-bearing assets.

Ensure composability so other DeFi projects can reuse the hedge module.

ðŸ’» Commit: feat: implement inflation hedge contract with stablecoin + tokenized asset rebalancing

Phase 4: DeFi Yield Integration

Integrate DeFi protocols for yield farming and liquidity pools.

Automate allocation between inflation hedges and yield strategies.

ðŸ’» Commit: feat: add DeFi yield strategies and liquidity pool integration to portfolio management

Phase 5: Global Scaling & Localization

Expand oracle integrations for global CPI datasets and localized FX rates.

Add flexibility for multiple jurisdictions/countries.

Enable multi-asset retirement portfolios.

ðŸ’» Commit: feat: expand Aureus protocol with multi-country CPI data and localized FX support

Extra Hackathon Winning Edge

Show composability: Aureus modules can be plugged into pensions, payroll savings, or NGO treasury management.

Emphasize impact: A solution for savers in high-inflation economies.

Stress Rust + Soroban security as a differentiator.
